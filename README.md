# note-stickers #

(an unshared application based on "[shareable-note-stickers](https://github.com/rozek/shareable-note-stickers)")

![NoteStickers Screenshot](./NoteStickers-Screenshot.png)

"NoteStickers" is the first step in a series of implementation and user studies towards a modern variant of Apple's famous but hopelessly underrated [HyperCard](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard)

(work in progress)

[live demo](https://rozek.github.io/note-stickers/dist/) (right now, for internal testing only - there still seems to be a really strange but fundamental problem when running from GitHub.io compared to an instance running from a local server...)
